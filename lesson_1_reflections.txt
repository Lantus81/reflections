How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that was introduced?
This way i can focus on things that was changed when there was no bug and that can help me to narrow my search a lot. depending on how much line of codes has been changed.

I will spend less time on searching the bug.

cons: i can forget to commit my  work

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?
Because files are often connected to each other.

i can use log to see all changes thure time. and i can use diff to see what is the change beatwine two commits.
